2. Add three numbers and print the total
His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.

A) Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
Algorithm: Total = x + y +z 
Pseudocode:
1. Promt user for for three numbers
2. Get "x", "Y" and "Z",our numerical inputs
3. Apply algoritm specified (Total = x + y +z)
4. Display total 
B)Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing steps
Input: numberInput1, numberInput2, numberInput3, value from user
Process: Apply algorithm (Total = x + y +z)
Output: Total
C) What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
sequence
D) What variables are required?
input variable (numberInput1, numberInput2, numberInput3)
Output variable (total)
E) Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
numberInput1 = 5
numberInput2 = 6
numberInput3 = 7
total = 5+6+7=18
