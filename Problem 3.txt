4. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240").
 Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. 
 Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

Algorithm:  V1 = (S1*12)*(S2*12)*(rainfall)
					V2 = volume in cubic inches/231
Pseudocode:
1. Promt user for roof dimensions and inches of rainfall
2. Get "S1", "S2",our roof dimensions, rainfall
3. Apply algoritm specified (V1 = (S1*12)*(S2*12)*(rainfall)
					         V2 = volume in cubic inches/231)
4. Display 	V1 and V2 
B)Create an IPO diagram showing input, output, and processing steps
Input: sideOne,SideTwo, rainfallInches
Process: Apply algorithm (V1 = (S1*12)*(S2*12)*(rainfall)
					         V2 = volume in cubic inches/231)
Output: VolumeOne, VolumeTwo
C) What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
sequence
D) What variables are required?
input variable (sideOne,SideTwo, rainfallInches)
Output variable (volumeOne, volumeTwo)
E) Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

sideOne = 50 ft
sideTwo = 20 ft
rainfallInches = 1"

volumeOne = (50*12)*(20*12)*1=144,000 CUBIC INCHES
volumeTWO = VolumeOne/231=623.38
